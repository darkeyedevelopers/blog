With 23+ blog posts being written every single second (Wow :flushed:!) and a total of 500 million online blogs, the internet has become a new Pacific of information. So we thought, why not to add a few more drops from our side?

## Technology, Programming & Development
In the coming weeks, months and years we will be posting content on various technical topics, things we have learned from our past projects, competitive programming, guest posts & some non-usual things that we usually do.

## GitHub + Jekyll
![Github + Jekyll][github-jekyll-image]

This blog is built with '[Jekyll][jekyll-link]' - a famous static site generator so that we can focus more on content than backend stuff. DED’s Blog (to save your precious time & few keystrokes of mine, I will be using “DED’s Blog” in place of “DarkEye Developers’ Blog” in this post) is hosted on [GitHub Pages][github-pages-link], well thanks to GitHub for this or should I thank Microsoft? :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

And did I forget to mention that we have used the [Sleek][sleek-link] Jekyll theme for this blog? Thanks to [@janczizikow][janczizikow-link] too for this simple yet awesome theme (believe me, it’s terribly hard to select a perfect theme from so many available out there on the internet).

## Who "we" are & What do "we" really do ?
If you are not from a not-so-famous ‘Walchand College of Engineering’ in the small city of Sangli, Maharashtra, India, there is rarely a chance that you know who we are. (And even if you are from our institute, there is a fairly low chance of you knowing who we are…:sweat_smile:). DarkEye Developers is a small team of computer enthusiasts who like spending their precious time on open source projects, blogging & competitive coding.

We have done projects in Web Development, Desktop App Development, Browser extension & recently published our own pure JS library for node and browser. We have worked with DJango, JavaFX, Unity, Java, JavaScript, C++, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML and (hmm…:thinking: yeah that’s it!).

We like open source and most of our projects are also open source. You can check them out [@darkeyedevelopers][darkeyedevelopers-link].
